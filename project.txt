Some initial data analysis to identify how inflammation changes over time after a surgery.
Jane is a Data Engineer and Samit is a Statistician.
Who is responsible for what in this project?
We will still need a data scientist to help Samit implement PCA and visualisation
The data scientist will probably need Python skills and be able to use matplotlib
and plotnine for visualisation.
A bonus is if they can do version control.
